# Prison Management System
___
This is a prison management application, build from the perspective of the data it consumes, processes and stores. The first phase of the project dealt with the definition of the mini-world, and the software requirements specification. This was converted into an entity-relation model in the second phase, while was translated into a relational model and normalised upto the 3rd normal form in the third phase. In the fourth phase, the database schema was used to build a basic command-line application.
